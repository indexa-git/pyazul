# PyAzul Configuration Management

Configuration for the `pyazul` library is managed through the `AzulSettings` Pydantic model, defined in `[pyazul/core/config.py](mdc:pyazul/pyazul/core/config.py)`.

## Loading Configuration
*   By default, `PyAzul()` (see `[pyazul/index.py](mdc:pyazul/pyazul/index.py)`) initializes `AzulSettings` by loading values from a `.env` file in the project root and then from environment variables (environment variables override `.env` values).
*   A custom, pre-configured `AzulSettings` instance can also be passed directly to the `PyAzul` constructor: `PyAzul(settings=my_custom_settings)`.

## Key Configuration Variables (in `.env` or as environment variables)

*   **API Credentials**:
    *   `AUTH1`: Your primary Auth1 key. Used for all API requests.
    *   `AUTH2`: Your primary Auth2 key. Used for all API requests.
    *   `MERCHANT_ID`: Your merchant identifier. Used for all API calls and for the Payment Page.
*   **Certificates**:
    *   `AZUL_CERT`: Path to your SSL certificate file OR the full PEM content as a string.
    *   `AZUL_KEY`: Path to your SSL private key file OR the full PEM content as a string OR Base64 encoded PEM content.
    *   The library handles writing PEM content to temporary files if direct content is provided (see `_load_certificates` in `[pyazul/core/config.py](mdc:pyazul/pyazul/core/config.py)`). The `AzulAPI` client in `[pyazul/api/client.py](mdc:pyazul/pyazul/api/client.py)` uses these settings to establish its SSL context.
*   **Environment**:
    *   `ENVIRONMENT`: Set to `dev` for development/testing or `prod` for production. Controls API endpoints.
*   **Payment Page Settings (Optional, if using Payment Page)**:
    *   `AZUL_AUTH_KEY`: Authentication key for generating the payment page hash.
    *   `MERCHANT_NAME`: Your business name displayed on the page.
    *   `MERCHANT_TYPE`: Your business type.
*   **Other**:
    *   `CHANNEL`: Default payment channel (e.g., "EC" for E-Commerce).
    *   `CUSTOM_URL`: Optionally override base API URLs.


Consult `[pyazul/core/config.py](mdc:pyazul/pyazul/core/config.py)` for all available settings fields.
The [README.md](mdc:pyazul/README.md) provides a `.env` example and further details.
