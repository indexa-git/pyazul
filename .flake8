# pydocstyle configurations through flake8-docstrings
# For pydocstyle convention and ignore, these are typically passed as CLI or in its own config.
# However, flake8-docstrings might pick up some, or you might need a separate pydocstyle config.
# For now, we'll set what's directly supported by flake8 or common plugins.

# The `match` and `add_ignore` for pydocstyle are specific to pydocstyle's own config or CLI.
# If flake8-docstrings doesn't translate these directly, a separate pydocstyle config might be needed
# or you'd rely on pydocstyle's defaults/direct CLI invocation if used outside flake8.
# We will keep the pydocstyle section in pyproject.toml for now and revisit if needed.
